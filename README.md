• Currently learning and growing on my journey to becoming a developer — one line of code at a time

• Fun Fact: I may look intimidating, but I'm genuinely friendly once you get to know me. I love making meaningful connections!

• Feel free to connect with me on Discord, Roblox, or GitHub — I'm always open to collaborating and making new friends.
